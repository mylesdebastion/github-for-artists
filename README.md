## Advanced Techniques

### Creating a New Repository via CLI

To create a new GitHub repository using the command line interface, you can use the GitHub API. Follow these steps:

1. **Generate a personal access token:**

   - Go to your GitHub account settings.
   - Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Personal access tokens" and then the "Generate new token" button.
   - Give your token a description, select the "repo" scope, and click "Generate token."
   - Copy the generated token and store it safely; you won't be able to see it again.

2. **Use `curl` to make an API request to create a new repository:**

Replace `your_username` and `your_token` with your own GitHub username and the personal access token you generated in step 1.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token your_token" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name": "your_repo_name", "description": "Your repository description", "private": false}'
```



### Creating a New Repository via CLI

To create a new GitHub repository using the command line interface, you can use the GitHub API. Follow these steps:

1. **Generate a personal access token:**

   - Go to your GitHub account settings.
   - Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Personal access tokens" and then the "Generate new token" button.
   - Give your token a description, select the "repo" scope, and click "Generate token."
   - Copy the generated token and store it safely; you won't be able to see it again.

2. **Use `curl` to make an API request to create a new repository:**

Replace `your_username` and `your_token` with your own GitHub username and the personal access token you generated in step 1.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token your_token" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name": "your_repo_name", "description": "Your repository description", "private": false}'
```

Replace "your_repo_name" and "Your repository description" with the desired name and description for your new repository. Set "private" to true if you want to create a private repository, or false for a public one.

This command sends a POST request to the GitHub API to create a new repository under your account with the specified name, description, and visibility.

Note: Sharing your personal access token can give others access to your account, so handle it carefully and avoid including it in scripts or public repositories.



### Creating GitHub Issues via CLI

To create new GitHub Issues using the command line interface, you can leverage the GitHub API. Follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have a personal access token with the "repo" scope:**

   - If you don't have a personal access token, refer to the previous subsection on creating a new repository via CLI for instructions on how to generate one.

2. **Use `curl` to make an API request to create a new issue:**

Replace `your_username`, `your_repo`, and `your_token` with your own GitHub username, the target repository name, and your personal access token.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token your_token" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" https://api.github.com/repos/your_username/your_repo/issues -d '{"title": "Issue Title", "body": "Issue Description"}'
```

Replace "Issue Title" and "Issue Description" with the desired title and description for your new issue. This command sends a POST request to the GitHub API to create a new issue in the specified repository.

Note: Sharing your personal access token can give others access to your account, so handle it carefully and avoid including it in scripts or public repositories.


### Using Git Large File Storage (LFS) for Artists

Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension for Git that replaces large files, such as images, videos, and other binary assets, with text pointers inside Git, while storing the actual file contents on a remote server. LFS is especially relevant for artists and can help improve the performance and management of repositories containing large assets.

1. **Why Git LFS is relevant to artists:**

   - Artists often work with large files like high-resolution images, videos, 3D models, and other binary assets.
   - Regular Git repositories can become slow and difficult to manage when handling large files.
   - Git LFS helps artists maintain a smooth workflow by efficiently tracking large files, making cloning and pulling faster.

2. **Getting started with Git LFS:**

   - Install Git LFS by following the instructions on the [official website](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
   - Navigate to your repository and run `git lfs install` to initialize LFS.
   - Use `git lfs track` followed by the file type pattern (e.g., `*.psd`, `*.blend`, `*.mp4`) to track specific file types.
   - Remember to commit the `.gitattributes` file created by Git LFS, as it keeps track of the file types you want to track with LFS.

**Note:** Git LFS usage may incur additional costs depending on your GitHub plan, and it may also affect your storage and bandwidth limits. Be sure to review the [Git LFS pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-git-large-file-storage) before using it extensively.



### Using `.gitignore` for Technical Artists

A `.gitignore` file is used to specify files and folders that should not be tracked by Git. This can be particularly helpful for 3D Maya artists who want to exclude temporary, cache, or other unnecessary files from their repositories. 

1. **Why `.gitignore` is useful for technical artists:**

   - Helps keep the repository clean by excluding unwanted files.
   - Reduces repository size by avoiding the tracking of large temporary or cache files.
   - Simplifies collaboration by ensuring only relevant files are shared among team members.

2. **Creating and using a `.gitignore` file:**

   - Create a new text file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your repository.
   - Add patterns (file types, folder names, or specific files) that you want to ignore, one per line.
   - Save the file and commit it to your repository.

3. **Typical examples for 3D Maya artists:**

```
# Ignore Maya temporary files
*.mayaSwatches
*.swatch

# Ignore Maya autosave files
*.ma.autosave
*.mb.autosave

# Ignore Maya cache files
cache/
*.mcx

# Ignore Maya viewport cache files
*.m3d

# Ignore rendered image sequences
images/
*.iff
*.exr
```
